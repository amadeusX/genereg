    Our  MySQL Database in a gzipped mysqldump file (656 MB) with the descriptions of tables and  variables.
    The number of jointly bound (last but one column) and the all bound transcriptional regulators last column) in co-regulated or independently expressed human gene pairs in six cell types:
        cRPGs, pairs of genes coding for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (n= 4,657)  (n indicates the number of gene pairs)
        mRPGs, pairs of genes coding for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins ( n= 3,486)
        HE-NRGs, pairs of highly expressed non-ribosomal genes (n= 14,186)
        NRG_A's (R > 0.9, n = 20,247)
        NRG_B's (0.9>= R > 0.8, n = 833,393)
        NRG_C's (independently expressed pairs of genes, abs(R) < 0.1, n= 100,000)
